# How would i introduce **QPython** my country

**QPython** is basically a new application which is still not introduced in Pakistan, it is not widely accepted there ,however with proper introduction of the application to the programmers and the student this could help them develop
We can prepare seminars regarding **QPython** so students and programmers would be aware of it, as we know **Facebook** and **Twitter** is massively used in Pakistan we can create Events and Pages regarding **QPython**, we can also give students and programmers live streams about the benefits of using **QPython**, as we know Pakistan is an under developing country and it needs to be convinced that **QPython** is better than any other editors,The software can be introduced in a short term in the beginning like colleges that give Diploma degree they will easily accept the new change however Universites needs a proper time and reasoning.As i have done many seminars in my country i can gurantee you that Universites dont accept change easily,If your team helps me in setting up a seminar they might change the course,as I am going to my home country in July I could help set up all these camps,*A SMALL BUT LARGE OPERATION*
